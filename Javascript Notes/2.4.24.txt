Control Statements:

Looping Statements: Loops are used in JavaScript to perform repeated tasks based on a condition. Conditions typically return true or false . A loop will continue running until the defined condition returns false .

1. while
2. do while
3. for
4. forEach
5. for in

1. while: Executes the statments until the condition becomes false.

    Syntax:

        while(expression) {
            // Statements...
        }

2. do while: Executes the statments until the condition becomes false. But if condition is becoming for every iteration it executes statments for one time.

    Syntax:

        do {
            // Statements...
        } while(expression);

3. for: Executes the statments until the condition becomes false.

    Usecase: We will be using this we have define no of iterations.

    Syntax:

        for (initialization; condition; increment/decrement) {
            // Statements...
        }

4. for in: Iterate collection of properties present in object.

    Syntax:

        for (let key in objectName) {
            objectName[key];
        }
